                  Pentecostal Theological College was established in 1968.
                  At that time the training was in local languages to Pastors and other church workers.
                  Since then, over 2000 Students have graduated and are active in church ministries in Uganda,
                  Rwanda, Sudan and Kenya. In 1983 the college introduced a three-year diploma program 
                  in Bible and Theology as well as  developed a team of highly qualified and committed Faculty members who are passionate 
                  in empowering learners to reach their maximum potential and so we are known for this academic
                   excellence in theological education and exercising transformational leadership skills in the 
                   field. In 2011, Pentecostal Theological College got licensed by NCHE, and also added two certificates 
                  i.e. Certificate in Church Ministries (CCM) and Certificate in Church Administration 
                  and Management (CAM). In 2014, Pentecostal Theological College opened the department of community transformation 
                  where five diploma programmes were accredited by National Council for Higher Education (NCHE).
                   A government body mandated to License Higher Institutions in Uganda.
