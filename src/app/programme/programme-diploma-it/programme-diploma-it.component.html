                                            Information Technology program is designed to provide learners with foundational skills, knowledge and competencies in
                                             ICTs that enable them to install, oversee, tune, trouble-shoot and maintain computer systems and design solutions to
                                              common ICT challenges in organizations and among individual ICTs users. It is intended to provide learners with hands-on 
                                              abilities so they can be ICT support staff in an organization or to start their own ICT services to meet the pervasive 
                                              need for ICT technicians as computers become a must-have and essential gadget.
