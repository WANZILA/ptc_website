                    Our library is charged with the responsibility of serving the reading, reference and research 
                    needs of students, and staff of the College of Pentecostals. Therefore, 
                    Pentecostal theological library is built with a collection containing the materials 
                    that best suit the objectives of that clientele both now and in the future...

                            students, and staff of Pentecostal theological college. The library takes an active role in 
                            supporting the overall mission of PTC by providing access to relevant information through the 
                            development of library collections, their organization and arrangement for access and use, and the provision of appropriate information and instructional services. To be most effective in fulfilling its mission, the library offers an array of basic services funded by the College for current students, faculty, 
                            and staff; other services to this primary clientele may be offered on 
                            a full or partial cost recovery basis.

                            <p class="text-justify"> A library with a relevant and adequate collection is not built 
                                in a single month or year. It's a gradual process that takes time and with a 
                                carefully thought collection of development policy. With this in mind, we at 
                                Pentecostal Theological College celebrate our strengths and pride while 
                                recognizing what remains to be done to realize our vision.</p>
                            <p> The College Already has a solid foundation of print textbooks and some 
                                electronic open access databases to fill the information needs of our students, 
                                faculty staff and other scholars. Our Library is a learning center on campus, 
                                an environment where students can read from, use computers or textbooks, study 
                                and innovate. It is a place for our students to enrich their academic life and be 
                                inspired to set and reach higher goals as we strive to produce ethical and responsible Christian leaders.</p>  
                            <p>The success of our Library so far has depended on our continuity to align library
                                 goals with the goals of the college as a whole. Therefore, the library department 
                                 continues to provide leadership in the planning and development of Academic 
                                 programmes that are central in strengthening and enhancing the vision of the college.
                                  We, at Pentecostal Theological College Library strive to serve our Students even better.
